            I'm Isaac Newton. A 20 yr old Full Stack Wev Dev with roughly 4 yrs of experience<br />
            I am very skilled with java for backend and python too. I know C and C# basically for algorithm solving<br />

            I have a couple of hobbies like basketball and music. My current fav song is pressure by wizkid.
            <br />I've made some cringe rap tracks too. I should probably stick to programming.
